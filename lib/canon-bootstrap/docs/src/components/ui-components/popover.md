    <p>Use the popover in conjunction with <a href="#details">Details</a> and <a href="#edit-button">Edit Button</a> to edit data or with the <a href="#primary-buttons">Primary Button</a> to add or create data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The notch of the popover always points to the title (key, link, or button) of the element you are editing or viewing.</li>
      <li>The popover should cover any information that you are editing.</li>
      <li>Popover buttons have reserved space at the bottom. Save button labels should indicate what action you are performing and  always relate to the subject of the popover.</li>
      <li>Clicking outside the popover should close it. Interaction with elements under the popover is restricted until closed.</li>
      <li>Don't force-fit multi-step processes into popovers.  That sort of interaction should be acheived using full-page views.</li>
      <li>Try to avoid spawning popovers from popovers.  Keeping the interaction as flat as possible is the key to clean design.</li>
      <li>Avoid spawning popovers on hover.  They should not behave like tooltips.</li>
      <li>Specify form sizes to match the width of the longest label: xsmall, small, medium, large, xlarge, xxlarge.</li>
    </ul>
