UI components are reusable elements that combine to form UX Patterns. If you are using these for the first time, please read through the component details carefully. The “Adherence Rating” of each pattern explains how strict implementation must be to ensure usability. If you need new components/patterns for your app or if would like to participate in creating additional ones, please let us know.


Adherence Rating Scale:

<ol>
  <li><strong>Just a suggestion</strong> - Use it if you like it! Your implementation can vary. You may choose to use a similar pattern of your own.</li>
  <li><strong>A really good idea</strong> - Some really good thought was put into this. Try and follow the guidelines.</li>
  <li><strong>Sort of strict</strong> - Significant design and research went into the production of this pattern. Implementation should follow guidelines pretty closely overall.</li>
  <li><strong>Basically the law</strong> - A lot of research and design went into this pattern. It has been widely accepted as the standard at Rackspace. Implementation must be exactly as prescribed in this article.</li>
</ol>
