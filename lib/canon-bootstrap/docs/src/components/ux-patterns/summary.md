    	<p>UX Patterns consist of <a href="/documentation/ui-components.html">UI Components</a> that have been arranged and combined into templatized views. Our patterns and widgets have been tested and tweaked for optimal usability and to meet user needs. These patterns accelerate design and development processes by providing a framework for most interactions in an application. </p>
        <h3>How do I use UX patterns?</h3>
        <p class="max-width-large">Different roles benefit in different ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>UX Designers</strong> use patterns to ensure consistency and accelerate decision making when designing application workflows.</li>
          <li><strong>Interaction Designers</strong> can grab markup from patterns to facilitate rapid prototyping.</li>
          <li><strong>Front-End Developers</strong> can reference components that make up each pattern and know exactly what is needed to build views.</li>
          <li><strong>Back-End Developers</strong> can reference UX patterns to help inform the construction of back-end logic based on standard workflows.</li>
        </ul>
